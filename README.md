## Midterm Exam

### Preparation Tips
- Make sure you understand the different cases for insertion and deletion in a doubly linked list
  - Insertion at the end
    - Empty
    - Non-empty

  - Deletion
    - Already empty
    - Only one node
    - First node
    - Last node
    - Middle node

- Make sure you know how to draw a diagram of a linked list and walk through your code with that diagram
  - I can't emphasise enough how useful this is for debugging. If you're not passing a test and you know how to walk through your code with a diagram, it can save your life.

- Get some practice with linked list questions
  - Sample midterm
  - Practice exercises on the course website

- Get familiar with basic tree operations such as search and insertion
- Get some practice with tree questions, especially using recursion
  - Lecture examples (search and insertion)
  - Sample midterm
  - Practice exercises on the course website
  - Week 3 and 4 lab/tutorial exercises

### Exam Tips
- Make sure you understand the data structure (which will probably be defined in the .h file)
  - Is it a doubly linked list?
  - Does it have a last pointer? Or just a first pointer? Under what circumstances do you need to update these?
  - Does it have a size/nitems field? Do you need to update this?

- List out the different cases

- If you're not 100% confident or you're failing a test and you're not sure why, draw a diagram and walk through your code using that diagram

- Test your code yourself - the autotest might not cover all of the cases
